    <p class="about__descr">
      I started to become interested in web development relatively recently. Accidentally watching a video on YouTube with a review of someoneâ€™s layout became a discovery for me and shocked me in a good way at that time.
      I began to study this direction more deeply and it turned out that it was not just interesting to me, but so exciting that even sleepless nights were a joy!
      Then I completed courses from SkillBox on Layout and Java Script, while simultaneously getting practice in implementing various layouts. Now I try to improve my skills every day and hope that development will become my main activity.
